Use the steps from Level1 to Level2 stages until you establish a connection with SSH terminal of this challenge
Step 1) ls
data.txt is shown
Step 2) cat data.txt gives us giberish values and this result is not relevant to us hence we narrow it down
Step 3) strings data.txt
This commands shows all the human readable strings in the file, it here shows a big list of values and by scrolling throung it we might encounter words like "password" , 
"here is" etc. . The hitn is that our password is somewhere near a series of "=" hence we pipe our strings result into grep to find our flag
Step 4) strings data.txt | grep "=="
Here we used "==" because alot of other values had "=" associated with them and the output looked ugly.
