Use the steps from Level1 to Level2 stages until you establish a connection with SSH terminal of this challenge
Step 1) ls
Another directory
Step 2) cd inhere
Step 3) ls 
Here is find a total of 10 files which are starting with '-f'. Linux does not directly treat this as a file and hence we have to use special methods to bypass this problem
Step 4) file ./-f*
This above command will recognize ass the files starting with -f as a normal executable files and give the output about what type of file it is. Our goal here was to find
human readable file (ASCII in this case) which comes out to be file07
Step 5) cat ./-file07
