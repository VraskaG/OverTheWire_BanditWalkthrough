Use the steps from Level1 to Level2 stages until you establish a connection with SSH terminal of this challenge
Step 1) ls
data.txt is shown
Step 2) cat data.txt gives us a huge number of possible flags as a result. The challenge is that our flag is never repeated.
When we try uniq -u command, we do not get the answer reason being uniq comapares the lines which are right next to each other and hence we have to sort our flags first
We use the method of pipeling here
Step 3) sort data.txt | uniq - u
What this line does is that it first sorts our flags in data.txt and makes that output as an input for our uniq command and hence we get out flag
