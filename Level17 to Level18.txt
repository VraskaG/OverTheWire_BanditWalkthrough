We have to use the private key from the file we saved from our last challenge in this one
Step 1) ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i bandit17.key
We also have to change the file permisssion of bandit17.key to only readable and we do that using chmod
Step Extra) chmod 400 bandit17.key
Step 2) ls
We get two files and the there is a change in one line which is our flag for the next challenge
Step 3) diff -u password.old password.new
We get an output stating the one different line, the line below is our key
