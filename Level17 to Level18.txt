We have to use the private key from the file we saved from our last challenge in this one
Step 1) ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i bandit17.key
Step 2) ls
We get two files and the there is a change in one line which is our flag for the next challenge
Step 3) diff -u password.old password.new
We get an output stating the one different line, the line below is our key
(Both the lines are keys if you pick the other line you would also have to do level 18-19 so stay aware of this)
