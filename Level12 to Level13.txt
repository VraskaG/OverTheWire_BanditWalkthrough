Use the steps from Level1 to Level2 stages until you establish a connection with SSH terminal of this challenge
Step 1) This is a quit different challenge as we have a highly compressed file. We can find out about which type of file it is to find what sort of compression tech has been
done on it
file data.txt
This command gives us the type of the file which is either .tar, gzip or bzip2
Step 2) Create another directory mkdir /temp/flag 
Copy data.txt there - cp data.txt /temp/flag
Rename the file - mv data.txt data.(here wehatever the file type it is .tar for tar file, .gz for gzip files and .bz for bzip2 files)
Step 3) Decompress the file using these techniques - 
tar -xf [FILENAME] for tar files
gzip -d [FILENAME] for gzip files
bzip2 -d [FILENAME] for bzip2 files
And check the file type after the compression
Step 4) Keep repeating Step 3 until your file type comes out to be an ASCII type which will be your flag
