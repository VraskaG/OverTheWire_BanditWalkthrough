Use the steps from Level1 to Level2 stages until you establish a connection with SSH terminal of this challenge
Step 1) ls
Another directory
Step 2) cd inhere
Step 3) ls 
Here there will be several directories and these directories contain several files and directory inside them. We cannot manually find our fill hence we are going to make use of find
command
Step 4) We would have to make changes in our find command here 
find .
This means search in the current directory
find . -type f -size 1033c
This means to find the file in thsi directory which is a normal file and has size of 1033 bytes
find . type f -size 1033c ! -executable
This means to find the file in this directory which is a normal file and has size of 1033 bytes and is also non executable.
Hence we get our next flag in maybehere07 .file07
Step 5) cd maybehere07 
        cat '.file07'
